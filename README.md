 # About This Project #
 
## - Problem Statement ##
*Aim*: The main aim to develop the project was to understand and apply the microservice architecture and how different independent components can work together and communicate.


*Description*: Microservices architecture is used in many real-life scenarios in the tech industry. It provides improved fault isolation, i.e., if one service fails, the complete application most likely won't fail. This is because each microservice runs independently. This also helps greater compliance and smoother workflow among teams. In this project, 3 separate microservices were built: Book, Customers, and Orders. Each of them was built separately and the rest wouldn't crash if the server is not running for a particular one.
