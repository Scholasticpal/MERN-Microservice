 # About This Project #
 
## - Problem Statement ##
*Aim* : The main aim to develop the project was to understand and apply the microservice architechture and how different independent components can work together and communicate.

*Description*: Microservices Architechture is used in many real life scenarios in the tech industry. It provides improved fault isolation, i.e., if one service fails, the completely application most likely wont fail. This is each microservice runs independently. This also helps greater compliance and smoother workflow amoungst teams. In this project, 3 seperater microservices were built: Book, Customers and Orders. Each of them were built seperately and the rest wouldnt crash, if the server is not running for a particular one.

## - What is KrishiTech? ##
Is a website that is used to calculate the output based on input parameters for crop production
Additional Features:
  * Seasons Detection
  * User Friendly
  * Multiple Languages
  * Website can operate on 3G Mobile phones
 
**Importance of Fertilizers **
From the graph, wheat with low phosphorus has scanty yield than wheat with sufficient phosphorus. This tells us an  addition of fertilizer to the crop has a huge impact on the yield of the wheat crop.
